    <p><h1>Welcome to my personal portfolio.</h1><br/>
       Here you will find some information about me. As is says on this page, my name's Brett Wiggins and I am 43 years old.
       I am a Mature Aged Student at Deakin University, studying online at Cloud Campus. I have recently enrolled in the Bachelor
       of Cyber Security Degree and am working my way through the first lot of units.<br/><br/>
       During COVID lockdowns that affected Melbourne I returned to school to study Cyber Security at Box Hill Institute. I have
       been awarded a Certificate IV in Cyber Security and an Advanced Diploma in Cyber Security.<br/><br/>
       My background was Military. I served with the Australian Army and was deployed oversears with the United Nations.
       Since leaving Defence I have had a wide variety of work, from working as a Console Operator at a service station,
       to working in the IT department at a Hospital.<br/><br/>
       I am activley looking for work as I study at Deakin. I'm hoping to get my first Cyber Security job soon. Feel 
       free to contact me via the contact page or follow me on Social Media.
